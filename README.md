Inventory Project assignment with Oracle Academy. This project progresses throughout Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the course. After each section there will be more to add until it
builds into a complete Java application to maintain Inventory. For each part, I will build upon the last part so that both the old and new requirements are met.
